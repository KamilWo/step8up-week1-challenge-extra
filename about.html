    <h2>From a Simple Idea to a Tech Revolution</h2>
    <p>BootCamp Inc. was born from a simple yet powerful idea: that anyone with passion and determination deserves a
      clear path into the tech world. Founded by industry veterans who saw a gap between traditional education and
      real-world job requirements, we set out to create an immersive, project-based learning experience. We're not
      just a bootcamp; we're a launchpad for the next generation of innovators.</p>
